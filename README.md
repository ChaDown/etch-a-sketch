# etch-a-sketch

This is a simple etch-a-sketch application. As you hover over a square, it will change to a random colour. As you move the cursor around the page, you can make cool designs. 

There are also grid size and clear buttons featured. The grid size enables you to change the dimensions of the grid, with max dimensions 100x100. The clear button clears your drawing. 

The main learning in this project was reinforcing CSS and also DOM manipulation. The grid elements in the DOM are created in the JS file using a dynamic loop which changes dpending on the user input. There are also many event listeners throughout the project, which are essential to it's functionality.
